# Image-Classification

I developed a straightforward machine learning model designed to classify images. In this project, I utilized basic examples such as sunflowers, rugby, and ice cream, although this model can classify various other categories. For generating the data, I employed the bing image downloader library to collect images and skimage to standardize their size and format. Since this is a classification task, I incorporated gridsearchCV with SCV as the estimator. To deploy this model as a web application, I employed streamlit and pyngrok.
